h1. gtfs-engine

@gtfs-engine@ is a "Rails Engine":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html which will add GTFS(General Transit Feed Specification) support to your application. It provides both the resources and controller actions necessary to provide a RESTful interface to one or more GTFS data sets.

See "*sangster.github.io/gtfs-engine*"://sangster.github.io/gtfs-engine more more information on how to use this engine.

h2. Sub-Components

This Rails Engine relies on the "gtfs-reader"://github.com/sangster/gtfs-reader rubygem to process the actual ZIP files in which GTFS data sets are provided.
