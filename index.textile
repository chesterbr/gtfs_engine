h2. Introduction

This "GTFS(General Transit Feed Specification) Engine" is a "Rails Engine":rails-engine which will allow your Rails application to process GTFS feeds and model their associations through __ActiveRecord__ objects.

This project is currently a sub-component of the "KnowTime Server":knowtime-git project, but hopefully can of use to others projects. This project also depends on another GitHub project, "GTFS Reader":gtfs-reader-git, to actually process the __.zip__ files in which GTFS feeds are contained.
